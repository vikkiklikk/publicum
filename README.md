Everything and nothing.

I'm studying computer science at the University of Iceland.
Aspiring web-dev.
Doing a little career change as a 34 year old.
Always had a thing for everything computer related but ended up not going for it when I was younger.

Will post some projects related to curriculum or little personal projects.

Reykjavik, Iceland.
